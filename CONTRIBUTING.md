# Contributing to PeoplePods (Community Revival)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PeoplePods! üéâ  
This project is the **community-maintained revival** of the original PeoplePods SDK (by XOXCO, Inc.), updated for PHP 8+ and modern web development.  
Contributions of all kinds are welcome ‚Äî from bug reports and documentation to new features and themes.

## üìå How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use [GitHub Issues](../../issues) to report bugs or request features.
- Please include:
  - A clear description of the problem.
  - Steps to reproduce (if it‚Äôs a bug).
  - Your environment (PHP version, MySQL/MariaDB version, OS).
  - Screenshots or logs (if relevant).

### 2. Suggesting Features
- Open a **feature request issue** first before writing code.
- Explain *why* the feature would be useful.
- Propose how it fits into the PeoplePods ecosystem.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-feature
  ```
- Make your changes, following our [Coding Guidelines](#-coding-guidelines).
- Write clear commit messages (e.g., `fix: resolve caching issue in Twitter theme`).
- Submit a Pull Request with:
  - A clear description of what you changed and why.
  - References to related issues (if any).

### 4. Writing Documentation
- Improvements to `README.md`, `INSTALL.txt`, and inline code comments are very welcome.
- If you add a new feature, update documentation so others can use it.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Guidelines

- Target **PHP 8+** (strict types and modern syntax where possible).
- Follow PSR-12 coding style (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).

Please also include:
- Screenshots (for themes).
